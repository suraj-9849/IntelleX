# IntellexAI - Intelligent Video Surveillance
<img src="public/image.png" />
## 🚀 Inspiration

Traditional surveillance systems are passive and often fail to provide timely insights, leaving security teams overwhelmed with countless video feeds. IntellexAI was built to bridge this gap by transforming video surveillance into an intelligent, real-time security solution. Our goal is to enhance public and private safety by enabling automated threat detection, reducing response times, and ensuring no critical event goes unnoticed. From local businesses to large-scale facilities, IntellexAI ensures that security is proactive rather than reactive.

## 🛠 What It Does

IntellexAI is an AI-powered surveillance platform that:
- Detects crime, suspicious activities, and emergencies (e.g., fainting, choking, fighting).
- Sends real-time alerts to security teams via email and phone notifications.
- Generates time-stamped incident reports with video evidence.

### 🔑 Key Features
1. **Real-time Video Analysis** using Google's Gemini Visual Language Model.
2. **MP4 Upload Feature** for crime and event analysis on recorded footage.
3. **Investigation Mode** allows users to ask AI to analyze videos for specific events (e.g., detecting people smoking with timestamps and frames).
4. **Event Library** stores analyzed videos with security insights and timelines.
5. **AI-Powered Assistance** via OpenAI for real-time context-aware guidance.
6. **Statistics Page** with AI summaries, chart-based insights, and CSV export.
7. **Live Robo Camera Integration** via IP-based Arduino-powered tracking.
